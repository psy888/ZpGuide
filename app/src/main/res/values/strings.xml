        attracting the most people to the region. It is the biggest island on the Dnieper River and
        the subject of many myths and legends. The island is famous for its unique nature and
        interesting archeological findings. The traces of many cultures and epochs are interwoven
        here: in the past, Khortytsia was a home for Scythians, Sarmates, Pechenegs, and many others.
        But the most vivid scenes of the island’s history are undoubtedly connected to the Zaporizhian
